# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gather earthquake from a GEOJSON file and plot results on a map using Leaflet.js library, Javascript and HTML.

## Overview
The map is very user friendly and offers the user different ways to view the map. There are filters that toggle three different geographical views of the map. A user can also click within the circles depicted on the map to view the magnitude and location of a specific earthquake. On the top left corner, the user may also interact with a zooming function.
